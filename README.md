- **React 18** for building modern UI components
- **TypeScript** for type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** for easy and customizable styling
- **ESLint** for maintaining code quality
- **Lucide Icons** for a sleek icon library

```

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vite-react-typescript-starter
npm install
```

---

## Available Scripts

Here’s a list of commands you can use during development:

### Start Development Server

Run the development server with hot module replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Here's an updated project structure section for the `README.md` file based on the provided atomic design pattern:

## Folder Structure

This project follows the **Atomic Design Pattern**, making it easy to organize components by their reusability and complexity:

```
vite-react-typescript-starter/
├── node_modules/       # Installed dependencies
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── components/     # Organized components
│   │   ├── Atoms/      # Smallest building blocks (e.g., buttons, inputs)
│   │   ├── Molecules/  # Combinations of atoms (e.g., forms, cards)
│   │   ├── Organism/   # Larger structures built with molecules (e.g., header, footer)
│   │   ├── Layout/     # Layout components (e.g., grid, containers)
│   │   ├── Pages/      # Full-page components
│   │   └── Templates/  # Reusable page templates
│   ├── resources/      # Static resources (e.g., images, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── App.tsx         # Main app component
│   ├── index.css       # Global CSS styles
│   ├── main.tsx        # Application entry point
│   └── vite-env.d.ts   # TypeScript Vite environment declarations
├── .gitignore          # Ignored files for Git
├── eslint.config.js    # ESLint configuration
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── package-lock.json   # Lock file for dependencies
├── package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
├── postcss.config.js   # PostCSS configuration
├── tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind CSS configuration
├── tsconfig.app.json   # TypeScript configuration for the app
├── tsconfig.json       # Base TypeScript configuration
├── tsconfig.node.json  # TypeScript configuration for Node.js
├── vite.config.ts      # Vite configuration
```

### Key Concepts in Atomic Design:

- **Atoms**: The smallest components, such as buttons, input fields, or labels.
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms working together, such as a form with inputs and a submit button.
- **Organisms**: Larger UI sections made up of molecules, such as a navigation bar or a footer.
- **Templates**: Page-level components that define layouts using organisms and molecules.
- **Pages**: The actual application views, utilizing templates and components.

This structure ensures a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase.
